Implement UCSBCurriculumController.

Look at the code from S21 proj-ucsb-courses-search.

There is a controller that allows the frontend to access results from
the UCSBCurriculumService.

Bring that code into this code base, including testing.

# Acceptance Criteria

TODO: Students should write their own.   Look at the ACs from the team01 assignment to get an idea of what this should look like.

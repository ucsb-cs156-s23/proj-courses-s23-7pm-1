Create Basic Search Front End

There is already component that allows you to select a quarter from a dropdown menu;
it appears in the Storybook and has full test coverage.

Add an additional component that allows you to select a level (UG-lower div, UG-upper div, grad, all).  The levels can be hard coded. 

You can use code from the S21 proj-ucsb-courses-search as a model.

For this story, the Search button only needs to bring up a toast that says:
"If search were implemented, we would have made a call to the back end to get
courses for x subject, x quarter, x level".

A later issue will hook this up to get the backend info.

Implement UCSBCurriculumService

Look at the code from S21 proj-ucsb-courses-search.

There is a UCSBCurriculumService.

Bring that code into this code base, including testing.

Refer to the documentation at <https://developer.ucsb.edu>.

If you need credentials; Prof. Conrad can supply these to your team (ask on Slack.)

You can also apply for an account directly: ask only for these APIs (which are all auto-approved).  Asking for more than this could delay your request.

* Academics: Academic Curriculums 
* Academics: Academic Quarter Calendar
* Students: Student Record Code Lookups

Use the code from the team01 assignment as a model.

# Acceptance Criteria

TODO: Students should write their own.   Look at the ACs from the team01 assignment to get an idea of what this should look like.

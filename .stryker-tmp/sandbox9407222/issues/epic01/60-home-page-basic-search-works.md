Create Basic Search Front End

Using the quarter selector, subject area selector, level selector,
the backend route, and the course table, implement a basic search function
that shows information for the high level courses only.

It will not have details of sections (e.g. no day/time, instructor etc.).
That's for the next class to implement.

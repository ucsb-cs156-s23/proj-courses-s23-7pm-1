Implement a Level Selector Component

There is already component that allows you to select a quarter from a dropdown menu;
it appears in the Storybook and has full test coverage.

Add an additional component that allows you to select a level (UG-lower div, UG-upper div, grad, all).  The levels can be hard coded. 

You can use code from the S21 proj-ucsb-courses-search as a model.

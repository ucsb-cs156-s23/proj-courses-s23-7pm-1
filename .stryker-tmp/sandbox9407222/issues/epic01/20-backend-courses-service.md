Implement UCSBSubjectsService

There is a stub in the code for a UCSBSubjectsService. Currently it 
delivers a `List<UCSBSubject>` of three hard coded `UCSBSubject` objects.

Modify it to, instead, use the UCSB Developer API to get 
subjects from the endpoint

* `https://api.ucsb.edu/students/lookups/v1/subjects?includeInactive=false`

You can use the documentation at <https://developer.ucsb.edu>.

If you need credentials; Prof. Conrad can supply these to your team (ask on Slack.)

You can also apply for an account directly: ask only for these APIs (which are all auto-approved).  Asking for more than this could delay your request.

* Academics: Academic Curriculums 
* Academics: Academic Quarter Calendar
* Students: Student Record Code Lookups

Use the code from the team01 assignment as a model.

# Acceptance Criteria

TODO: Students should write their own.   Look at the ACs from the team01 assignment to get an idea of what this should look like.

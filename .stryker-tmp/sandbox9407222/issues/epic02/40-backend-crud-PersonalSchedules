Backend CRUD personal schedules

I recommend breaking this issue up into multiple issues.

In this issue you will create backend Swagger endpoints for crud operations
for Personal Schedules.

In this epic, we will not yet reach the point where you will be able to
actually add or delete courses from these schedules; for now they, are just
objects with:

* Name
* Description
* Quarter

And, like the Todos in the sample code for demo-spring-react-example-v2,
they *belong to a user*.

So we need the full set of operations where:
* For admins, admins can manipulate EVERYONE's personal schedules objects
* For users, they can only manipulate their own.

This is basically just reimplementing the Todo's entities, repositories, and controllers
but with Name/Description/Quarter instead of the fields for Todos.

Add your own ACs, and break this up into multiple issues as needed.

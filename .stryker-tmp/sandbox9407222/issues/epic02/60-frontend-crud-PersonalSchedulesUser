Front End Crud personal schedules (user)

I recommend breaking this issue up into multiple issues.

In this issue you will create front end components for
users to manipulate personal schedule objects.

You'll need an suitable menu on the menu bar.

You'll need a table to display personal schedules, with buttons for edit and delete.

You'll need a form for entering and editing them.
